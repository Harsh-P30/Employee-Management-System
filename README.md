Employee Record Management System







ðŸ“Œ Description:
The Employee Record Management System is a C++ console-based application designed using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. It allows efficient handling of employee information, making it ideal for small HR systems or academic projects.

This system provides a clean interface to manage employee records using core OOP concepts like:

Encapsulation (data hiding using private members)

Abstraction (user interacts with simple methods like addEmployee, searchEmployee)

Class & Object usage

Modularity through well-structured methods

âœ… Key Features:
Add Employees

Input personal, work, and contact details of employees.

Display All Employees

View a list of all entered employee records.

Search by ID

Retrieve details of an employee using their unique ID.

Update Records

Modify existing employee data by entering their ID.

Delete All Records

Clear all employee data with a confirmation prompt.

Exit Option

Cleanly terminate the application.

ðŸ§  OOP Concepts Used:
Class Employee handles all employee data and encapsulates input/output methods.

Class EmployeeSystem manages a collection of employee objects using a vector, enabling dynamic addition and updates.

Public and private access modifiers ensure clean data encapsulation.

Member functions provide abstraction for each functionality (add, update, search, delete).
